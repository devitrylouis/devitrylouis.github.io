This notion is vague..

"Ability to provide explanations that are humanly understandable"

Trutable models, learning guarantees and stability lead to a food interpretable model...

Structure is desirable!?

1. A supervised classification tasks
    * Propose a model of your data
    * Design a representation
    * Propose a classifier


# Interpreting first layers

Lots of structure in Alex net first layers. 

# Visualization

# Stability

# Invariance

# Feature distributions
