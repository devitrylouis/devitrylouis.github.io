## Convergence of random variables

### What is a random variable?

Random variables are central objects in statistics and probabilities. They are basically an application whose domain is the set of eventualities.

<b>Formal definition RV:</b>
<b>Probability / distribution of a RV:</b>
<b>Mean / variance of a RV:</b>
<b>What are i.i.d. RV?</b>

## Convergenes of the multivariate case

<b>Almost sure convergence:</b>
<b>Convergence in probability:</b>
<b>Convergence in $L^{p}$:</b> if the expectation of the $L^{p}$ norm converges toward 0.
