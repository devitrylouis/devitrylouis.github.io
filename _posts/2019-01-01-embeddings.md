An embeddings is a representation of an object (word, image) formulated as continuous vectors. They are constructed so that similar objects can have similar embeddings (metric learning). Usually, embeddings are not the final goal but are rather used as features (feature learning).

Most recently, embeddings have been learned with neural networks. However, they are not the end result of the network but the final (trained) parameters of the last layer of the encoder.

<b>Example: Convnet encoder</b>

- Train your ConvNet on a large supervised image-classification task (ImageNet)
- Encode your image with the ConvNet with the hidden layer between convolutional neural network  and fully connected network.

<b>Usefullness:</b>
- We can compute the <u>learned similarity distance</u> to find similar images.
- The <u>learned features</u> can be injected into another model

This neural network has to be trained to solve a particular task, but which one? This is detiled in the next paragraph:

# Word2vec: unsupervised word embeddings

Word2vec is a fast C++ tool to obtain word embeddings from an unsupervised corpus of text. It consists of two models:
- <u>SkipGram</u> which predict the surrounding words from the center word
- <u>CBOW:</u> predict center word from surrounding words

## SkipGram

Word2vec goes through a text corpus sequentially. When it encounters a given word $w$, it constructs a list of the pairs $(w, v)$ of each surrounding word $v$ (within a pre-defined window).

## CBOW

Once we have pairs of close words, our goal becomes to be able to predict that "love" should be close to "feeling".

This prediction is supported by a neural network with:

1. <u>Input:</u> Create vocabulary (one-hot encoder vector of a set of words). For the words "cat", "dog", "human": "dog" is represented as [0, 1, 0]. Typically, they have around 10k word.
2. <u>Hidden layer:</u> This is what we want, as the weights of this layer are the embeddings. It should have less neurons than words in our vocabulary ($\approx 300$)
3. <u>Output:</u> For each word $w$ construct a probability vector for every other words $v$ within the list of pairs generated by SkipGram.

We train this neural network with cross-entropy loss and SGD.

Ultimately, it produces a « lookup table » which transforms « love » into a word vector (i.e. its embedding).

<u>Note:</u> It is possible to encode bigrams ("irish setter") with word2vec.

## Optimizing the softmax

For large vocabulary $V$ the <i>softmax is expensive</i>. There are two solutions to fight this: <u>Negative sampling</u> or <u>Hierarchical softmax</u>.

Negative sampling objective is composed of two terms:
- <u>Attractive force:</u> reduce the distance between a word and one of its neighbors
- <u>Repulsive force:</u> increase the distance between a word and a random word

Note: word2vec can encode unigrams and bigrams

## Word similarity and analogy

Once these vectors are obtained with the above model, we can perform typical vector operations: (addition, angles)
- <u>Word similarity</u>
$$cos(\alpha) = \frac{w_{love}\cdot w_{affection}}{\mid w_{affection} \mid \mid w_{affection} \mid}$$
- <u>Word analogy</u>:
$$
w_{queen} \approx w_{woman} + (w_{king} - w_{man})
$$

# Variants and extensions of word2vec

## « FastText »

FastText adds character-level information by setting word embeddings as the sums of char-n-gram embeddings:

- $w_{love} = w_{lov} + w_{ove}$
- $w_{loving} = w_{lov} + w_{ovi} + w_{vin} + w_{ing}$

## Multilingual word embeddings

Aligning monolingual word embedding spaces by creating a linear mapper $W$ between the languages $X$ and $Y$.

It works by minimizing the reconstruction error between $Y$ and $WX$. Specifically the following objective is miminimzed:

$$
W^{*} = \text{argmin}_{W \in O_{d}(\mathcal{R})} \mid\mid WX-Y\mid\mid_{F} = UV^{T} \text{, with } U\Sigma V^{T}
 = SVD(YX^{T})$$
