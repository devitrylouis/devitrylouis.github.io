Work experience
======
* Machine Learning Engineer at Lucky Cart
  * March 2018 - Sep 2018, Paris
  * Leveraged both artificial intelligence and retail data to strengthen promotional strategy. To this end, I build predictive models that discriminate in real time the desirable factors of a promotion, in a world where 59% of them have a negative return on investment.

* Data Scientist at Shippeo
  * July 2017 - March 2018, Paris
  * Increased the supply chain performance, by predicting trucks arrival times and delays. To do so, I handled the full data-stack, from querying the database to building deep learning models with 98% accuracy. In the « just in time » setting of the supply chain, this research brought sizeable profits for clients.

* Operational Research Engineer at Shippeo
  * June 2016 - July 2016
  * Researched on diverse optimisation strategies to mutualise capacity in road transportation. The objective was to provide cost-reducing and eco-friendly solutions to our customers, as 15% of trucks are driving empty in France.

* Community Manager at Innovation Time
  * 2015, Lausanne
  * Handled the online presence of the student association Innovation Time, whose goal is to promote entrepreneurship among students. Our followers grew from 200 to 800 students on the main social networks.
