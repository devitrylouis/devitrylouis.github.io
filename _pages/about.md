My research interests lie in the Mathematical foundations that accounts for the booming success of Deep Learning techniques, and most generally AI. My recent work has taken a shift towards Computer Vision and Medical Imaging: Medical Image Segmentation and Registration.

In this blog, you will find some posts that I began writing during my master. Although it was mostly focused aroung documenting what I learnt, I am now thinking I would like this to be more open. If you have any ideas, shoot me an e-mail.

**Note:** Some links are still very much a work of progress. They are annotated with an asterisk *.

Highlight of my projects
------

* Multi Modal Medical Image Registration
* Organs at Risk Segmentation
* Identify the genre of a song (from raw audio)
* Infer social circles on social networks
* [Imaging time series](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoding-time-series-as-images-b043becbdbf3)
* Improve predictive power for consumer behavior in the retail industry
* Predict Estimated Time Arrival and delays of truck deliveries


Climate change
------
Outside on what I can learn about data science / AI related topics, I care a lot about climate change and the impact it will yield for earth and humans. Beside trying little things at my scale (biking to work, working on my vegetable garden, consuming less and better...) I do the best to educate myself and others on what will probably be the biggest challenge the world need to face.


Get in touch for a collaboration!

If you are doing great work on a project needing Artificial Intelligence to move forward, shoot me an e-mail. I would gladly discuss it with you. From startups to pure research, I am interested in a wide range of opportunities.
