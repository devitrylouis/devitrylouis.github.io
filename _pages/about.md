My research interests lie in the Mathematical foundations that accounts for the booming success of Deep Learning techniques, and most generally AI. I am about to finish my master and my aim is to pursue research endeavors in Computer Vision, NLP, Network science and Reinforcement Learning.

In this blog, you will find some publications and blogposts I wrote for myself and others. Most of these posts are inspired from my AI master and personal research. Altogether, it is a summary of personal projects, research, lecture notes and online content.

My projects in a nutshell
------
Beside a lot Most of my long term projects include:

* Multi Modal Medical Image Registration
* Organs at Risk Segmentation
* Identify the genre of a song (from raw audio)
* Infer social circles on social networks
* [Imaging time series](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoding-time-series-as-images-b043becbdbf3)
* Improve predictive power for consumer behavior in the retail industry
* Predict Estimated Time Arrival and delays of truck deliveries


Who I am?
------
I have been learning AI hands on for more than four years now. To give a little bit more context on my journy:

- 🇨🇭🇸🇪 **Mathematics at EPFL and KTH (Bachelor):** At EPFL, I received a broad and rigorous engineering education with a strong emphasis on Mathematics. I then went to KTH for an Erasmus program at which I picked all courses relating to Statistics, Processes and Learning. At the end of the Bachelor, I have written a thesis under Henrik Hult (25% of the credit) whose aim was to use Elastic Nets to find relevant renovation to increase real estate value.

- 🇫🇷 **Gap year (Internships):** In between my Bachelor and my Master, I choose to confront what I learnt to industry. I helped Shippeo leverage untapped GPS data to predict Estimated Time Arrivals of trucks ross Europe. As the first data member, I was lucky to work closely with clients and diverse departments of the company. I then joined Lucky Cart for a two fold mission; improve rare event prediction and build deep learning / auto ML internal packages for other data scientists. These experiences were full of insights on how data science teams operate alongside business and internally.

- 🇫🇷 **Centrale Paris (Master):** When it came to develop and implement state of the art methods in various domains, my theoretical background was lacking. I thus decided to go back to school and learn advanced AI at Centrale Paris. This master was dedicated to the theory and practice of both the fundamentals and state of the art. With applied and research projects on various fields (Computer Vision, NLP, Network Science, Reinforcement Learning and pre Machine Learning), I can assert it was an eye opening experience.

- 🇫🇷 **TheraPanacea:** After a 6 months internship, I joined as a permanent member TheraPanacea. There, most of my work consists in improving Medical Image Registration / Segmentation state of the art and push the methods to production. With scientific guidance from Nikos Paragios, our team is a pioneer in the use of AI and cutting-edge research to optimize diagnostics, prognostics and therapies for cancer and other complex diseases.

Altogether, these experiences forged me. I can now work on a variety of complex projects autonomously and convey the essentials to every kind of collaborators. In addition to these key skills, I have a deep desire to make the world a better place and impact people lives for the better.


Passions unrelated to Artificial Intelligence
------
Outside on what I can learn about data science / AI related topics, I find some hobbys gripping are:

- Climate change: Volunteer of the shift project.

- Biking: 

- Gardening: 


Get in touch for a collaboration!

If you are doing great work on a project needing Artificial Intelligence to move forward, shoot me an e-mail. I would gladly discuss it with you. From startups to pure research, I am interested in a wide range of opportunities.
