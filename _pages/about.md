Here is a collection of articles I wrote during the last year. It is a summary of my personal projects and research as well as on lecture notes and online content. It covers the basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, along with tools and domain specific articles (time series, NLP, visual computing, network science, music...). If possible and time permits, I will add Python code to code the algorithms from scratch or close to it; I am not trying to reinvent the wheel 😉.

Some of them are very much a work in progress. I update those on a daily basis (so stay tuned 📣). The articles that will be finished in the upcoming month are listed below:

If you are doing great work on a project needing Artificial Intelligence to move forward, shoot me an e-mail. I would gladly discuss it with you. From startups to pure research, I am interested in a wide range of opportunities.

My story
------
I have been learning AI hands on for more than two years. I began my journey with a strong Mathematics background to from EPFL. At KTH in Sweden, I followed introductory courses to Statistical Learning and Data Science.

After my Bachelor, I chose to have a gap year to put my learnings into practice and get familiar with the business environment. I learnt to build sound Macine Learning pipelines, from raw data to performant and scalable models.

However, when it came to develop and implement state of the art methods in various domains, my theoretical background was lacking. I thus decided to go back to school to learn advance AI at Centrale Paris (graduation in 2019). I am furthermore very interested in entrepreneurship.
